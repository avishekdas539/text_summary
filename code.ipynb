    "text = '''On June 7, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan told the state's chief secretary and DGP to probe the role of the management of the Ganga Jamna School in Damoh from multiple angles. Chouhan asked them to include allegations pertaining to land encroachment, evasion of GST, and also religious conversionâ€”a theme that has been playing out regularly in MP ahead of assembly elections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Ganga Jamna School came in the news when right-wing Hindu outfits accused the school management of forcing non-Muslim students to wear the hijab as part of the school uniform. The outfits raised the issue when the school put out a poster with pictures of girls who had done well in the Class 12 exams. The poster included pictures of non-Muslim girls wearing the hijab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The owner of the school, Mushtaq Khan, clarified that the head gear was a scarf and part of the uniform, but not mandatory. The Muslim family that runs the school has other businesses as well, such as of beedi and pulses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soon after, Damoh district magistrate Mayank Agarwal asked district education officer (DEO) S.K. Mishra and the Damoh police to look into the allegations. After receiving the report of the DEO and the police, the collector gave the school an all clear. This, however, made the state BJP turn against the district administration.\n",
    "\n",
    "On June 5, top BJP leaders in the state accused the school of carrying out religious conversions. Three faculty members, all women, were claimed to have been converted to the Islamic faith. The faculty members, however, said they had not been converted by the school and had changed their faith after marriage to Muslims.'''.replace(\"\\n\", \"\").lower()"
